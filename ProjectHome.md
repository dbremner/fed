FED (<b>F</b>ront-<b>E</b>nd for <b>D</b>osbox) is a graphical user interface for the DOS emulator <a href='http://www.dosbox.com/'>DOSBox</a>. It makes running games and changing DOSBox configuration very easy.

FED is developed for and tested on Windows XP and Windows Server 2008 R 2 (Windows 7). It is written in C# and requires the [.Net 2.0 Runtime](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en), which should already be included in Windows Vista and above.
